# dstools
This PowerShell module aims to simplify cmdlets and improve efficiency for a desktop support team. I noticed that I was running specific commands each day, multiple times to perform specific tasks. I decided that creating a module that included these functions would make it much easier, not only for me, but for the rest of my team to run commands and return results quickly. 

## Getting Started
To use this PowerShell module, save it to your PowerShell Module path. To find this path, open a PowerShell terminal and enter $env:PSModulePath. This may return multiple paths, but you may save the module in any of the paths (depending on if you want to share the module to other users who use your computer). Once the module is in your module path, start PowerShell and begin running commands! (get-command -Module dstools) will display a list of commands in the module. 

## Prerequisites
You will need PowerShell or PowerShell Core to use this module. 

## Built with
This module is built using PowerShell.
